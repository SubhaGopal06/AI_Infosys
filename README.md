# Project Name - AI-Enhanced Customer Support Ticket Resolution and Proactive Issue Prevention System

## Project Statement
This project aims to develop an advanced AI-powered customer support system that leverages historical ticket data analysis to predict recurring issues and proactively address potential concerns. By integrating LLMs like OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA for natural language processing and sentiment analysis with Google Sheets, Slack, and Email, the system will:

- Automate responses to common issues.
- Escalate high-priority tickets based on sentiment and urgency.
- Provide preemptive solutions to potential problems.

This solution will significantly enhance customer support efficiency, reduce response times, and improve overall customer satisfaction by addressing issues before they escalate.

## Outcomes
- **Predictive Issue Detection:** Automated generation of solutions for recurring support problems.
- **Real-Time Escalation:** Sentiment-based ticket prioritization for handling high-stress situations.
- **Automated Resolutions:** Seamless resolution of common issues integrated across multiple communication platforms.
- **Improved Efficiency:** Significant reduction in support ticket volume and enhanced first-contact resolution rates.
